# Feature Tasks

- [x] Define a ChessBoard class - should contain an 8x8 grid - Each cell in grid should have a color represented in RGB format. - black = (0,0,0) - white = (1,1,1) - blue = (0,1,1) - red = (1,.2,0)
- [x] should have add_red method that accepts a row and column as input which colors corresponding cell.
- [x] should have add_blue method that accepts a row and column as input which colors corresponding cell.
- [x] should have render method that displays the chess board on screen with red and blue shown in correct locations
- [x] should have is_under_attack method that return boolean if red is under attack by a blue piece horizontally, vertically or diagonally

- [x] queens on same row should be “under attack”
- [x] queens on same column should be “under attack”
- [x] queens on same diagonal should be “under attack”
